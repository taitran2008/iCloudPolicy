# iCloud Apps Privacy Policy




iContact Apps, iCalendars and Reminders are DAV clients help to sync your contacts, calendars, reminders from iCloud servers to your Android devices. As third-party apps, I did what Apple dont care for whose want to move their data from iPhone to Android.


I donâ€™t collect any data (emails, contacts, photos, ...) in your devices. Nothings. What is in your devices is stayed in your devices. Your login informations are managed and protected in the Android System (by using Android Accounts APIs) like another kind of accounts (Facebook, Twitters, ...). My apps just show the input user interface. They also work well with an app-specific password to sign in to your account when you enable 2-steps verification.
