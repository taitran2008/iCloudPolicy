# iCloud Apps Privacy Policy




[iContact Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tai.tran.icontacts), [iCalendars and Reminders](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tai.tran.calendar.free) are DAV clients help to sync your contacts, calendars, reminders from iCloud servers to your Android devices. As third-party apps, I did what Apple dont care for whose want to move their data from iPhone to Android.


I **donâ€™t collect any data** (emails, contacts, photos, ...) in your devices. **Nothings**. What is in your devices is stayed in your devices. Your login informations are managed and protected in the Android System ([by using Android Accounts APIs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html)) like another kind of accounts (Facebook, Twitters, ...). My apps just show the input user interface. They also work well with an [app-specific password](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397) to sign in to your account when you enable 2-steps verification.
