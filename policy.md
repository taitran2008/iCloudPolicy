# iContact Apps — Privacy Policy

**Last updated:** February 17, 2026

## Introduction

[iContact Apps](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tai.tran.contacts) ("the app", "we", "our") is a CardDAV client that syncs your iCloud contacts to your Android device. As a third-party app, we built what Apple doesn't provide — a seamless way for users who want to access and manage their iCloud contacts on Android.

This privacy policy explains what data the app accesses, how it is used, and how your information is protected.

## Data Collection & Storage

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data to our servers.** This includes, but is not limited to:

- Contact names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses
- Contact photos
- Apple ID credentials
- Device identifiers

**We have no servers that receive your data.** All your information remains exclusively on your device and Apple's iCloud servers. We never see, access, or store any of it on our side.

## Permissions We Request

The app requires the following Android permissions to function. Each is used solely for its stated purpose:

| Permission | Why We Need It |
|---|---|
| **Internet** | To communicate with Apple's iCloud CardDAV servers for syncing your contacts. |
| **Read / Write Contacts** | To read your local contacts and write synced iCloud contacts to your device's address book. |
| **Get Accounts** | To access the iCloud account you create within the app via Android's account system. |
| **Read / Write Sync Settings** | To manage sync schedules and allow you to configure automatic sync intervals. |

We do **not** request access to your call log, camera, microphone, location, or any other sensitive permissions.

## Account & Login Security

Your Apple ID credentials are **never stored by our app directly**. Instead, they are managed and protected by the Android operating system through the [Android AccountManager API](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/accounts/AccountManager.html). This is the same secure mechanism used by Google, Facebook, and other accounts on your device.

Our app only provides the sign-in user interface — the actual credential storage and protection is handled entirely by Android.

We fully support [app-specific passwords](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204397). If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Apple ID (which we strongly recommend), you can generate an app-specific password from Apple and use it to sign in securely. Your main Apple ID password is never required.

## How Sync Works

The app connects **directly** to Apple's iCloud CardDAV servers to sync your contacts. Here is how data flows:

1. **Your Device** ↔ **Apple's iCloud Servers** (via encrypted HTTPS connection)

That's it. There are no intermediary servers, no third-party APIs, and no analytics endpoints involved in the sync process. Your contact data travels only between your Android device and Apple's servers, encrypted in transit via HTTPS/TLS.

---

## Advertising

The app may display ads provided by **Google AdMob**. These ads are served by Google's ad network and are subject to [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

Google AdMob may collect:

- Device advertising identifier
- General device information (model, OS version)
- Ad interaction data (impressions, clicks)

You have the following options to control ads:

- **Opt out of personalized ads** in your Android device settings under **Google** → **Ads**
- **Remove all ads permanently** via a one-time in-app purchase within the app

We do not send any of your contact data or Apple ID information to ad networks.

## Children's Privacy

The app is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated revision date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
